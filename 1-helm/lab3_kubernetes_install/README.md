### Create a basic GKE cluster with minimal add-ons
- Setup your gcloud project configuration
```shell
$ gcloud config configurations create tokp01

$ gcloud init


Pick configuration to use:
 [1] Re-initialize this configuration [tokp01] with new settings 
 [2] Create a new configuration
 [3] Switch to and re-initialize existing configuration: [default]
Please enter your numeric choice:  1

Your current configuration has been set to: [tokp01]

You can skip diagnostics next time by using the following flag:
  gcloud init --skip-diagnostics

Network diagnostic detects and fixes local network connection issues.
Checking network connection...done.                                                                                                                                                              
Reachability Check passed.
Network diagnostic passed (1/1 checks passed).

You are logged in as: [tokp1009@gmail.com].

Pick cloud project to use: 
 [1] imposing-eye-398010
 [2] Enter a project ID
 [3] Create a new project
Please enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match list item):  1

Your current project has been set to: [imposing-eye-398010].
```

- Enable Kubernetes Engine API

```shell
$ gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
```

```shell
$ gcloud container clusters create "adv-k8s-cluster" \
        --zone "asia-southeast1-a" \
        --cluster-version "1.27.3-gke.100" \
        --release-channel "None" \
        --machine-type "e2-medium" \
        --num-nodes "2" \
        --cluster-dns=clouddns --cluster-dns-scope=cluster \
        --no-enable-master-authorized-networks \
        --no-enable-autoupgrade \
        --no-enable-managed-prometheus
```

- In case you get the error while creating the `GKE` cluster, because of the reason:
  
> Starting with `v1.26`, this code will no longer be included as part of the OSS kubectl. GKE users will need to download and use a separate authentication plugin to generate GKE-specific tokens. This new binary, `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`, uses the Kubernetes Client-go Credential Plugin mechanism to extend kubectlâ€™s authentication to support GKE. Because plugins are already supported by kubectl, you can switch to the new mechanism now, before `v1.26` becomes available.

```shell
# Install using "gcloud components install"
$ gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

- Get GKE credential

```shell
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials adv-k8s-cluster \
    --zone asia-southeast1-a
```

- Delete our GKE cluster if needed

```shell
$ gcloud container clusters delete adv-k8s-cluster \
    --zone asia-southeast1-a -q
```
